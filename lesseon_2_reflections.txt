What happens when you initialize a repository ? Why do you need to do it ?
- When a repository is initialized we get a .git hidden directory created in the repository, which is created so that it can keep track of the files and help git in knowing which files were modified / created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository ? What value do you think it offers ?
- staging area is a git concept where files are moved before a commit, the files still are available in the working directory but only the files added to staging area are available for a commit. The value that staging area offers is that while working you might not want to commit a file, so staging area is good for the files you actually do want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change ?
- Befor commiting we can use git diff and git diff --staged to check on the modifications done on a particular file, and from them can deduce whether the change is logical or not.

What are some situtations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized ? How ould branches help ?
- If we want to work on an experimental feature or a new feature without disturbing the main master branch we can use branches to achieve that. Branches help because the changes committed are on the branch and not the master branch.
